        <li><strong>Analysis Results:</strong> Analysis results, including scores, color analysis, fit analysis, and style tips, are stored locally on your device for your convenience. Thumbnail images may also be stored locally to help you identify past analyses.</li>

    </ul>
    
    <h3>Google Gemini AI and Photo Processing</h3>
    <p><strong>What information is processed using Google Gemini AI?</strong></p>

        <li>Image data converted to base64 format for analysis</li>
        <li>Language preferences for localized analysis results</li>
    </ul>

        <li>Providing personalized style recommendations and tips</li>
        <li>Comparing multiple outfits when using the comparison feature</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p><strong>Will the data be shared with any third parties? Where will this information be stored?</strong></p>
    <p>Your photos are processed by Google's Gemini AI service (via Firebase AI) in accordance with Google's privacy policies and terms of service. <strong>We do not share your photos with any other third parties beyond Google's AI services necessary for the app's functionality.</strong> Google processes your images temporarily for analysis purposes. We do not have control over Google's data retention policies for their AI services, but Google does not permanently store your images for our app's use beyond the analysis process.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Data Retention:</strong> Analysis results and thumbnail images are stored locally on your device. You can delete your analysis history at any time through the app settings, which will permanently remove all stored analysis data from your device. Photos sent to Google for analysis are processed temporarily and are not permanently stored by us.</p>
    
    <h3>Data Storage and Security</h3>
    <p><strong>Local Storage:</strong> Analysis results, scores, and thumbnail images are stored locally on your device using iOS's standard storage mechanisms. This data remains on your device and is not transmitted to our servers.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Photo Processing:</strong> When you analyze an outfit, your photo is converted to base64 format and sent to Google's Gemini AI service via Firebase AI for processing. The photo is processed by Google's servers temporarily during the analysis. We do not store your original photos on our servers.</p>
    
    <h3>Third-Party Services</h3>
    <p>We use the following third-party services:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Google Gemini AI (via Firebase AI):</strong> For outfit analysis and style recommendations. Your photos are processed by Google's AI services. Please review Google's privacy policy for information about how they handle your data.</li>
        <li><strong>Firebase:</strong> For app functionality and analytics. Firebase may collect anonymous usage data in accordance with their privacy policy.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Your Rights</h3>
    <p>You have the right to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Access your analysis history stored locally on your device</li>
        <li>Delete your analysis history at any time through the app settings</li>
        <li>Stop using the app at any time, which will prevent further data collection</li>
        <li>Contact us with questions or concerns about your privacy</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Since analysis results are stored locally on your device, you can delete all stored data by clearing your analysis history in the app settings.</p>
