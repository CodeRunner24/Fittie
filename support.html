    <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
    
    <h4>How does Fittie analyze my outfit?</h4>
    <p>Fittie uses Google's Gemini AI (via Firebase AI) to analyze your outfit photos. The app evaluates color coordination, fit analysis, body type compatibility, and provides personalized style recommendations based on advanced AI algorithms.</p>
    
    <h4>Are my photos stored or shared?</h4>
    <p>Your photos are processed through Google's Gemini AI service for analysis purposes. While the analysis is performed, your images are temporarily sent to Google's servers for processing. However, we do not permanently store your photos on our servers. Analysis results and thumbnail images are stored locally on your device for your convenience.</p>
    
    <h4>How accurate are the results?</h4>
    <p>The analysis is based on advanced AI algorithms that evaluate color harmony, fit, and style compatibility. For best results, use clear, well-lit photos that show your full outfit. Results are provided for informational and entertainment purposes to help guide your style choices.</p>
    
    <h4>Can I use photos from my gallery?</h4>
    <p>Yes! You can either take a new photo with the camera or select an existing photo from your photo library.</p>
    
    <h4>Can I compare two outfits?</h4>
    <p>Yes! Fittie includes a comparison feature that allows you to compare two different outfits side-by-side. This helps you make better fashion decisions by seeing which outfit works better for different scenarios.</p>
    
    <h4>How do I view my analysis history?</h4>
    <p>All your outfit analyses are saved locally on your device. You can access your analysis history through the Analysis tab in the app to review past outfits and track your style progress.</p>
